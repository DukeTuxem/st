# Custom build of st

This is my personal fork of st, for now including only the transparency patch and more importantly my favorite default settings.


### Added Features

- Transparency (alpha patch)


### Development Workflow / Personal Reminder

Only work with the `config.def.h` file. `config.h` is generated every time when (re)compiling.


### Small requirements

- Compositor for transparency (picom)
- [Hack Nerd Font Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/master/patched-fonts/Hack/Regular/complete/Hack%20Regular%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete%20Mono.ttf)
